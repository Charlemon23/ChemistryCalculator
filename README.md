# Chemistry Calculator

A full-featured terminal-based chemistry calculator designed for students, researchers, and professionals. This tool helps you compute molarity, molality, percent yield, dilutions, and balance chemical equations — using only the command line.

## Features

- Convert between grams and moles
- Calculate molarity, molality, normality, and percent yield
- Perform dilution calculations
- Balance chemical equations (full or reactants-only input)
- Terminal-only usage — no web server or GUI required
- Built with Python and powered by `molmass` and `chempy`
